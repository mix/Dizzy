# Dizzy

## DizzyActivityIndicatorView

A `UIActivityIndicator` -inspired `UIView` that allows you to set a custom image for the indicator. It takes advantage of `IBDesignable` and `IBInspectable` attributes available since XCode 6, which allows you to configure this indicator with your custom image and preview it in Interface Builder.

## Installation

It's one file, and a framework seems overkill, so it's easier to just drop it into your XCode project via copying or a submodule reference.
